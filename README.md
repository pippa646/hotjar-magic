# hotjar-magic

Ever run a survey on HotJar with a checkbox question, and then found it hard to analyse the download file for questions factoring in multiple columns?

I've created this little bit of code to help. Download your HotJar data as a CSV, then run this to get the multiple-response answers from  single-column, multiple-row format to True/False columns for every possible answer. No more blank rows; all the responses from one user will be in a single row.

The CSV you get will make it much easier to answer questions that combine single- and multiple-response answers. 

Happy analysing!
